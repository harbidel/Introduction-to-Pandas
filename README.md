# Introduction-to-Pandas
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
For this practicing i would advice using Anaconda Editor, because most of these libraries are already pre installed on it 
Note: this is a practicing note, i would advice to follow the comments to get what each codes works for.

Thanks.
